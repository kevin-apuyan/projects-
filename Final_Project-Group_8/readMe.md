      Pokemon Go Database

********************************************************************

Getting Started:

Listed below are the instructions on how to create a simple 
database for Pokemon Go Players on your computer. More 
information for each steps can be accessed by clicking 
on the provided links
.
**************************************************************

Prerequites:

You will need:
-A local machine running Windows, Linux, or macOS
-Wampp Server  
-*Notepad++
-A browser of your choice i.e Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox


*The built-it notepad is also okay to use, but to preserve word 
formatting,we recommend installing this.  

******************************************************************

Installation:
-Download and install Wampp* (download here: http://www.wampserver.com/en/#download-wrapper)
-Download and install Notepad++ (download here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
-Once installations are all done, your working directory should be C:/Wampp/www

*Wampp and Skype don't like each other, so you if you have the latter,
make sure it is closed and not running in the background

******************************************************************

Constructing the Database

-Start services for wampp (icon should be on the right handside of the taskbar)
-Open up your browser of your choice, and go to localhost/phpmyadmin
-login using your root or dba user login and password
- import an existing database (in this case, pokemon_go.sql)
-Once database is created, you can now create your webpages!

************************************************************************

Creating Webpages and Running Queries to Insert and Retrieve Data:

For this part, we used a combination of HTML, PHP, Bootstrap and CSS to be able to create
a functioning website that is responsible for inserting and retrieving existing
data from the database we created. Copy all files to the C:/wamp64/www folder

To check if the database is implemented properly, run the following pages by logging in using root as username
and for the password field, just leave it blank

www/index.php

Once it's fully loaded, you can now keep experimenting!
